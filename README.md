This repository contains a Java program that demonstrates several uncommon runtime exceptions and a deadlock scenario.  The code showcases scenarios that lead to IndexOutOfBoundsException, NullPointerException, ArithmeticException, and a deadlock condition between two threads.  Solutions to prevent each of these error cases are provided in a separate file.
